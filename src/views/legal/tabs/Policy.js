      We collect and use the following information to provide, improve and protect our Services:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Account.</em> We collect, and associate with your account, information like your name,
      email address, phone number, payment info, physical address, and account activity. Some of our
      services let you access your accounts and your information with other service providers. Some
      of this info we collect them through{' '}
      <a href="https://apparatusapp.com/" target="_blank">
        Apparatus App
      </a>{' '}
      Access Service that you consent with them to have.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Services.</em> Our Services are designed to make it simple for you to store Your Stuff,
      collaborate with others, and work across multiple devices. To make that possible, we store,
      process, and transmit Your Stuff—like files, messages, comments, applications, and photos—as
      well as information related to it. This related information can be things like your profile
      information that makes it easier to collaborate and share Your Stuff with others. Our Services
      provide you with different options for sharing Your Stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may choose to give us access to your contacts to make it easy for you to do things like
      share and collaborate on Your Stuff, send messages, and invite others to use the Services. If
      you do, we'll store those contacts on our servers for you to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Usage.</em> We collect information related to how you use the Services, including actions
      you take in your account (like sharing, editing, viewing, and moving files or folders). This
      helps us provide you with features like version history.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Services. This
      includes things like IP addresses, the type of browser and device you use, the web page you
      visited before coming to our sites, and identifiers associated with your devices. Your devices
      (depending on their settings) may also transmit location information to the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Cookies and other technologies.</em> We use technologies like cookies and pixel tags to
      provide, improve, protect and promote our Services. For example, cookies help us with things
      like understanding how you are interacting with our Services and improving them based on that
      information. You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability
      to use the Services. If our systems receive a DNT:1 signal from your browser, we'll respond to
      that signal as outlined <Link to="/legal/use-of-cookies">here</Link>.
    </p>
    <h3 className="mt-10">With whom</h3>
    <p>
      We may share information as discussed below, but we won't sell it to advertisers or other
      third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Others working for Ybit a Web That Matters product.</em> Ybit, uses certain trusted third
      parties (for example, providers of customer support and IT services) to help us provide,
      improve, protect, and promote our Services. These third parties will access your information
      only to perform tasks on our behalf in compliance with this Privacy Policy, and we'll remain
      responsible for their handling of your information per our instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Other users.</em> OOur Services display information like your name, phone number, profile
      picture, and email address to other users in places like your user profile and sharing
      notifications. When you register your Ybit account with an email address on a domain owned by
      your employer or organization, we may help collaborators find you and your team by making some
      of your basic information—like your name, team name, profile picture, and email
      address—visible to other users on the same domain. This helps us show you teams you can join,
      and helps other users share files and folders with you.
    </p>
    <p>Certain features let you make additional information available to others.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Other applications.</em> You can also give third parties access to your information and
      account - for example, via 
      <a href="https://docs.ybit.io/" target="_blank">
        Ybit APIs
      </a>
      . Just remember that their use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies
      and terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Ybit Team Admins.</em> If you are a user of a Ybit team, your administrator and the team
      owner, may have the ability to access and control your Ybit team account. Please refer to your
      organization's internal policies if you have questions about this. If you are not a Ybit team
      user but interact with a Ybit team user (by, for example, joining a shared folder or accessing
      stuff shared by that user), members of that organization may be able to view the name, email
      address, profile picture, and IP address that was associated with your account at the time of
      that interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Law & Order.</em> We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that
      such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with the law; (b) protect any person
      from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Ybit or our users; or (d)
      protect Ybit's property rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stewardship of your data is critical to us and a responsibility that we embrace. We believe
      that our users' data should receive the same legal protections regardless of whether it's
      stored on our services or on their home computer's hard drive. We'll abide by reasonable
      Government Request Principles when receiving, scrutinizing and responding to government
      requests (including national security requests) for our users' data:

      Access Service, encryption of files at rest, and alerts when new devices and apps are linked
