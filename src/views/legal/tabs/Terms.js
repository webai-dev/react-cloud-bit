    <h3 className="mt-10">Your Stuff & Your Permissions</h3>
    <p>
      When you use our Services, you provide us with things like your files, content, data,
      messages, contacts and so on ("<strong>Your Stuff</strong>"). Your Stuff is yours. These Terms
      don't give us any rights to Your Stuff except for the limited rights that enable us to offer
      the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      We need your permission to do things like hosting Your Stuff, backing it up, and sharing it
      when you ask us to. Our Services also provide you with features like photo thumbnails,
      document previews, commenting, easy sorting, editing, sharing and searching. These and other
      features may require our systems to access, store and scan Your Stuff. You give us permission
      to do those things, and this permission extends to our affiliates and trusted third parties we
      work with.
    </p>
    <h3 className="mt-10">Sharing Your Stuff</h3>
    <p>
      Our Services, through integrations let you share Your Stuff with others, so please think
      carefully about what you share.
    </p>
    <h3 className="mt-10">Your Responsibilities</h3>
    <p>
      You're responsible for your conduct. Your Stuff and you must comply with our <Link to="/legal/acceptable-use">

      You may use our Services only as permitted by applicable law, including export control laws
      and regulations. Finally, our Services are not intended for and may not be used by people
      under the age of 13. By using our Services, you are representing to us that you're over 13.
    </p>
    <h3 className="mt-10">Software</h3>
    <p>
      Some of our Services allow you to download client software ("<strong>Software</strong>") which
      may update automatically. So long as you comply with these Terms, we give you a limited,
      nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely to access the
      Services. To the extent any component of the Software may be offered under an open source
      license, we'll make that license available to you and the provisions of that license may
      expressly override some of these Terms. Unless the following restrictions are prohibited by
      law, you agree not to reverse engineer or decompile the Services, attempt to do so, or assist
      anyone in doing so.
    </p>
    <h3 className="mt-10">Beta Services</h3>
    <p>
      We sometimes release products and features that we are still testing and evaluating. Those
      Services have been marked beta, preview, early access, or evaluation (or with words or phrases
      with similar meanings) and may not be as reliable as Web That Matters's other services, so
      please keep that in mind.
    </p>
    <h3 className="mt-10">Our Stuff</h3>
    <p>
      The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other US and foreign laws. These Terms
      don't grant you any right, title or interest in the Services, others' content in the Services,
      Web That Matters and Ybit trademarks, logos and other brand features. We welcome feedback but
      note that we may use comments or suggestions without any obligation to you.
    </p>
    <h3 className="mt-10">Copyright</h3>
    <p>
      We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. We respond to notices
      of alleged copyright infringement if they comply with the law, and such notices should be
      reported using our <Link to="/legal/dmca-policy">Copyright Policy</Link>. We reserve the right
      to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing and terminate accounts of repeat
      infringers. Our person agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement on the Services is:
    </p>
    <ul className="list-unstyled">
      <li>Copyright Agent</li>
      <li>Web That Matters, LLC.</li>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 className="mt-10">Paid Accounts</h3>
    <p>
      <em>Billing.</em> You can increase your storage space, change to a paid plan and add paid
      features to your account (turning your account into a "<strong>Paid Account</strong>"). We'll
      automatically bill you from the date you convert to a Paid Account and on each periodic
      renewal until cancellation. If you're on an annual plan, we'll send you a notice email
      reminding you that your plan is about to renew within a reasonable period of time prior to the
      renewal date. You're responsible for all applicable taxes, and we'll charge tax when required
      to do so. Some countries have mandatory local laws regarding your cancellation rights, and
      this paragraph doesn't override these laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>No Refunds.</em> You may cancel your Ybit Paid Account at any time. Refunds are only
      issued if required by law. For example, users living in the European Union have the right to
      cancel their Paid Account subscriptions within 14 days of signing up for, upgrading to or
      renewing a Paid Account.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Downgrades.</em> Your Paid Account will remain in effect until it's cancelled or
      terminated under these Terms. If you don't pay for your Paid Account on time, we reserve the
      right to suspend it or reduce your storage to free space levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Changes.</em> We may change the fees in effect but will give you advance notice of these
      changes via a message to the email address associated with your account.
    </p>
    <h3 className="mt-10">Ybit Teams</h3>
    <p>
      <em>Email address.</em> If you sign up for a Ybit account with an email address provisioned by
      your organization, your organization may be able to block your use of Ybit until you
      transition to an account on a Ybit team, or you associate your Ybit account with a personal
      email address.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Using Ybit Teams.</em> If you join a Ybit team, you must use it in compliance with your
      organization's terms and policies. Please note that Ybit team is subject to your
      organization's control, or to an individual ownership. Your administrators may be able to
      access, disclose, restrict, or remove information in or from your Ybit team account. They may
      also be able to restrict or terminate your access to a Ybit team account. Don’t forget that
      all accounts are actually a team.
    </p>
    <h3 className="mt-10">Termination</h3>
    <p>
      You're free to stop using our Services at any time. We reserve the right to suspend or
      terminate your access to the Services with notice to you if:
    </p>
    <ul className="list-unstyled">
      <li>(a) you're in breach of these Terms,</li>
      <li>
        (b) you're using the Services in a manner that would cause a real risk of harm or loss to us
        or other users, or
      </li>
      <li>
        (c) you don't have a Paid Account and haven't accessed our Services for 12 consecutive
        months (inactivity).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We'll provide you with reasonable advance notice via the email address associated with your
      account to remedy the activity that prompted us to contact you and give you the opportunity to
      export Your Stuff from our Services. If after such notice you fail to take the steps we ask of
      you, we'll terminate or suspend your access to the Services.
    </p>
    <p>We won't provide notice before termination where:</p>
    <ul className="list-unstyled">
      <li>(a) you're in material breach of these Terms,</li>
      <li>
        (b) doing so would cause us legal liability or compromise our ability to provide the
        Services to our other users, or
      </li>
      <li>(c) we're prohibited from doing so by law.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 className="mt-10">Discontinuation of Services</h3>
    <p>
      We may decide to discontinue the Services in response to unforeseen circumstances beyond
      Apparatus' control or to comply with a legal requirement. If we do so, we'll give you
      reasonable prior notice so that you can export Your Stuff from our systems. If we discontinue
      Services in this way before the end of any fixed or minimum term you have paid us for, we'll
      refund the portion of the fees you have pre-paid but haven't received Services for.
    </p>
    <h3 className="mt-10">Services "AS IS"</h3>
    <p>
      We strive to provide great Services, but there are certain things that we can't guarantee. TO
      THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WEB THAT MATTERS AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND
      DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES. THE SERVICES
      ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Some places don't allow the disclaimers in this
      paragraph, so they may not apply to you.
    </p>
    <h3 className="mt-10">Limitation of Liability</h3>
    <p>
      WE DON'T EXCLUDE OR LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU WHERE IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO DO SO—THIS
      INCLUDES ANY LIABILITY FOR WEB THAT MATTERS'S OR ITS AFFILIATES' FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT
      MISREPRESENTATION IN PROVIDING THE SERVICES. IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF
      EXCLUSIONS AREN'T ALLOWED, WE'RE RESPONSIBLE TO YOU ONLY FOR LOSSES AND DAMAGES THAT ARE A
      REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO USE REASONABLE CARE AND SKILL OR OUR BREACH OF
      OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU. THIS PARAGRAPH DOESN'T AFFECT CONSUMER RIGHTS THAT CAN'T BE WAIVED OR
      LIMITED BY ANY CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT.
    </p>
    <p>
      IN COUNTRIES WHERE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ARE ALLOWED, WEB THAT MATTERS, ITS
      AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WON'T BE LIABLE FOR:
    </p>
    <ul className="list-unstyled">
      <li>
        i. ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR
      </li>
      <li>ii. ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      THESE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT WEB THAT MATTERS OR
      ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    </p>
    <p>
      IF YOU USE THE SERVICES FOR ANY COMMERCIAL, BUSINESS OR RE-SALE PURPOSE, WEB THAT MATTERS, ITS
      AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT,
      LOSS OF BUSINESS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY. WEB THAT MATTERS AND
      ITS AFFILIATES AREN'T RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF
      THE SERVICES.
    </p>
    <p>
      OTHER THAN FOR THE TYPES OF LIABILITY WE CANNOT LIMIT BY LAW (AS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION),
      WE LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU TO THE GREATER OF $20 USD OR 100% OF ANY AMOUNT YOU'VE PAID
      UNDER YOUR CURRENT SERVICE PLAN WITH WEB THAT MATTERS.
    </p>
    <h3 className="mt-10">Resolving Disputes</h3>
    <p>
      <em>Let's Try To Sort Things Out First.</em> We want to address your concerns without needing
      a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Web That Matters, you agree to try to
      resolve the dispute informally by contacting{' '}
      <a href="mailto:dispute-notice@webthatmatters.com">dispute-notice@webthatmatters.com</a>.
      We'll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not
      resolved within 15 days of submission, you or Web That Matters may bring a formal proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Judicial forum for disputes.</em> You and Web That Matters LLC agree that any judicial
      proceeding to resolve claims relating to these Terms or the Services will be brought in the
      federal or state courts of New York City, NY, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions
      below. Both you and Web That Matters consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such
      courts. If you reside in a country (for example, European Union member states) with laws that
      give consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts, this paragraph doesn't
      affect those requirements.
    </p>
    <h3 className="mt-10">
      IF YOU'RE A U.S. RESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:
    </h3>
    <p>
      <em>We Both Agree To Arbitrate.</em> You and Web That Matters agree to resolve any claims
      relating to these Terms or the Services through final and binding arbitration by a single
      arbitrator, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below. This
      includes disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this
      "Mandatory Arbitration Provisions" section, including its enforceability, revocability, or
      validity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate.</em> You can decline this agreement to arbitrate and
      submitting the opt-out form within 30 days of first registering your account. However, if you
      agreed to a previous version of these Terms that allowed you to opt out of arbitration, your
      previous choice to opt out or not opt out remains binding.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Arbitration Procedures.</em> The <a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">
        American Arbitration Association (AAA)
      </a>{' '}
      will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary
      Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will be held in the United States
      county where you live or work, New York (NY), or any other location we agree to.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Arbitration Fees and Incentives.</em> The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration
      fees. Web That Matters will pay all arbitration fees for individual arbitration for claims
      less than $75,000. If you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer
      we make to resolve the claim, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the award. Web That
      Matters will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator
      determines that your claim is frivolous.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.</em> Either you or Web That Matters may assert
      claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in New York (NY) or any United States county
      where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop
      unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example,
      trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or
      the informal dispute-resolution process described above. If the agreement to arbitrate is
      found not to apply to you or your claim, you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state
      and federal courts in New York City, NY to resolve your claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        <em>NO CLASS ACTIONS.</em>
      </strong>{' '}
      You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a
      plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class
      arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other
      arbitrations aren't allowed. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the
      entirety of this "Mandatory Arbitration Provisions" section will be deemed void.
    </p>
    <h3 className="mt-10">Controlling Law</h3>
    <p>
      These Terms will be governed by New York law except for its conflicts of laws principles.
      However, some countries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require
      agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer's country. This paragraph doesn't
      override those laws.
    </p>
    <h3 className="mt-10">Entire Agreement</h3>
    <p>
      These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Web That Matters with respect to
      the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or
      contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these
      Terms. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.
    </p>
    <h3 className="mt-10">Waiver, Severability & Assignment</h3>
    <p>
      Web That Matters' failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later.
      If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in
      full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as
      possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will
      be void. Web That Matters may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or
      to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.
    </p>
    <h3 className="mt-10">Modifications</h3>
    <p>We may revise these Terms from time to time to better reflect:</p>
    <ul className="list-unstyled">
      <li>(a) changes to the law,</li>
      <li>(b) new regulatory requirements, or</li>
      <li>(c) improvements or enhancements made to our Services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If an update affects your use of the Services or your legal rights as a user of our Services,
      we'll notify you prior to the update's effective date by sending an email to the email address
      associated with your account or via an in-product notification. These updated terms will be
      effective no less than 30 days from when we notify you.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don't agree to the updates we make, please cancel your account before they become
      effective. Where applicable, we'll offer you a prorated refund based on the amounts you have
      prepaid for Services and your account cancellation date. By continuing to use or access the
      Services after the updates come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
